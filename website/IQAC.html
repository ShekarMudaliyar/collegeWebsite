<h2>What is IQAC?</h2>
<p align="justify">
In pursuance of the National Action Plan of the National Assessment
and Accreditation Council (NAAC), Bangalore, for performance
evaluation, assessment and accreditation and quality upgradation of
institutions of higher education, the NAAC proposes that every accredited
institution should establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a
post-accreditation quality sustenance measure. Since quality enhancement
is a continuous process, the IQAC will become a part of an institution’s system
and work towards realising the goals of quality enhancement and sustenance.
The prime task of the IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent
and catalytic improvement in the performance of institutions. The IQAC will
make a significant and meaningful contribution in the post-accreditation phase
of institutions. During the post-accreditation period, the IQAC will channelise
the efforts and measures of an institution towards academic excellence.
The guidelines provided in the following pages will facilitate the institution
in the creation and operation of the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC).
The work of the IQAC is the first step towards the internalization and
institutionalization of quality enhancement. Its success depends upon the
sense of belongingness and participation it can inculcate in all the constituents
of the institution. It will not be yet another hierarchical structure or record-
keeping exercise in the institution; it will be a facilitative and participative
voluntary system/unit/organ of the institution. The IQAC has the potential
to become a vehicle for ushering in quality by working out intervention
strategies to remove deficiencies and enhance quality. Quality circles in
industries operate on similar lines

The Primary Tasks of IQAC are:
<ul>
<li>To develop a system for conscious, consistent and catalytic improvement in the overall performance of institution.</li>
<li>To channelize all efforts and measures of the institution towards promoting its holistic academic excellence .</li>
</ul>
